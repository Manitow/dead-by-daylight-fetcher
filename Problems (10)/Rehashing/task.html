  <p>One limitation of the described hash table is that it can store only a fixed number of entries. Your task here is to address the limitation and implement a <code>rehash</code> method. It should work as follows: when a current table is full, it allocates a new array of a larger size, iterates through the old array and puts each element&nbsp;to the new array. Then, the new array is used to insert new entries. Assume that the initial size of a table is 5 and the scaling factor is 2.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:&nbsp;</strong>the first line contains an integer $n$,&nbsp;the number of insertions. Each of the following lines contains an entry: an integer key and a string value.</p>

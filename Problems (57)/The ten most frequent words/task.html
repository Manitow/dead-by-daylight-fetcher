  <p>Write a program that reads a text (in the UTF-8) from the standard input. The program must count the frequency of words in the text and print the 10 most frequent words.</p> 
  <p>A word is a sequence of characters consisting only of digits and letters. For example, the string "Functions bring happiness!" has three words: "Functions", "brings", "happiness".</p> 
  <p>The counting words should be case-insensitive, i.e. "Functions", "functions" and "FUNCTIONS" are the same word. Output words in the lower case.</p> 
  <p>If the text has less than 10 unique words, output as many as there are.</p> 
  <p>If some words in the text have the same frequency, order them lexicographically as well. For details, see here (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order</a>).</p> 
  <p>The problem has a beautiful solution using streams without any loops and conditional operators. Try to write it.</p>

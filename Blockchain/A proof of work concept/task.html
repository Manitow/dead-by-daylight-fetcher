<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The security of our blockchain is pretty low. You can't just change some information in the middle of a blockchain, because the hash of this block will also be changed. And the next block still keeps the old hash value of the previous block. But can't we replace the old hash value with the new hash value so everything will be ok? No, because when you change the value of the previous hash in the block, the hash of this block will also be changed! To fix this, you need to change the value of the previous hash in the block after it. To solve this problem, you need to fix hash values in all the blocks until the last block of the blockchain!<br>
<br>
This seems to be a pretty hard task to execute, doesnâ€™t it? If the time it takes to fix the hash value of the previous block is less than time to create a new block, we suddenly would be fixing blocks faster than the system can create them and eventually we will fix them all. The problem is that fixing the hash values is easy to do. The blockchain becomes useless if it is possible to change information in it.<br>
<br>
The solution to this is called <strong>proof of work</strong>. This means that creating new blocks and fixing hash values in the existing ones should take time and shouldn't be instant. The time should depend on the amount of computational work put into it. This way, the hacker must have more computational resources than the rest of the computers of the system put together.<br>

The main goal is that the hash of the block shouldn't be random. It should start with some amount of zeros. To achieve that, the block should contain an additional field: a <strong>magic number</strong>. Of course, this number should take part in calculating the hash of this block. With one magic number, and with another, the hashes would be totally different even though the other part of the block stays the same. But with the help of probability theory, we can say that there exist some magic numbers, with which the hash of the block starts with some number of zeros. The only way to find one of them is to make random guesses until we found one of them. For a computer, this means that the only way

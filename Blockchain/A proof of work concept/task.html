<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The security of our blockchain is pretty low. You can't just change some information in the middle of a blockchain, because the hash of this block will also be changed. And the next block still keeps the old hash value of the previous block. But can't we replace the old hash value with the new hash value so everything will be ok? No, because when you change the value of the previous hash in the block, the hash of this block will also be changed! To fix this, you need to change the value of the previous hash in the block after it. To solve this problem, you need to fix hash values in all the blocks until the last block of the blockchain!<br>

This seems to be a pretty hard task to execute, doesnâ€™t it? If the time it takes to fix the hash value of th

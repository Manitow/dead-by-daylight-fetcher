<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>The blockchain itself shouldn't create new blocks. The blockchain just keeps the chain valid and accepts the new blocks from outside. In the outside world, there are a lot of computers that try to create a new block. All they do is search for a magic number to create a block whose hash starts with some zeros. The first computer to do so is a winner, the blockchain accepts this new block, and then all these computers try to find a magic number for the next block.<br>
  <br>
  There is a special word for this: <strong>mining</strong>. The process of mining blocks is hard work for computers, like the process of mining minerals in real life is hard work. Computers that perform this task are called <strong>miners</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  Note that if there are more miners, the new blocks will be mined faster. But the problem is that we want to create new blocks with a stable frequency. For this reason, the blockchain should regulate the number N: the number of zeros at the start of a hash of

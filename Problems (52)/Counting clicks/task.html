  <p>There is a <strong>LogEntry</strong> class for monitoring user activity on your site. The class has three fields:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>created: Date </strong>- the date of creating log entry</li> 
   <li><strong>login: String</strong> - a user login</li> 
   <li><strong>url: String</strong> - a url that the user clicked</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The class have getters for all fields with the corresponding names (getCreated(), getLogin(), getUrl()).<br> <br> Write a collector that calculates how many times was each url clicked by users. The collector will be applied to a stream of log entries for creating a map: <strong>url</strong><strong> -&gt; click count</strong>.<br> <br> The class<strong> LogEntry </strong>will be available during testing. You can create your own classes for local testing.</p>

  <p>The Java standard Hashtable class has a method called&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html#entrySet--" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">entrySet</a>&nbsp;that allows users to iterate over the entries of a&nbsp;table. Your task here is to implement a simplified version of the method for the described hash table.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:&nbsp;</strong>the first line contains an integer $n$ -- the number of queries. Each of the next $n$ lines contains two records separates by space: the first&nbsp;represents an integer key, the other&nbsp;corresponds to&nbsp;a string value.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output:&nbsp;</strong>for each unique id, print all entries associated&nbsp;with&nbsp;the id. All ids can be printed in arbitrary order, entries should be printed in the same order as they were inserted into a table.</p
